# WVU ARC - High altitude ballooning(HAB) Documentation

This repository is used to maintain documentation that are generated from the ARC-HAB projects.

For wide usability [Obsidian-md](https://obsidian.md) is recommended as a cross platform interface for note taking. If you are an advanced user feel free to choose other options
## Setup instructions 

### Mac/linx

Git is used as the main method of syncing/sharing documentation and progress. 

1. Make a git account
2. Install git on your computer. (on mac/linux can be done on the cmd, on windows needs an installer)
3. generate ssh-keys: `ssh-keygen` press enter all the way. this will make a rsa key typically inside `~/.ssh`
4. add the ssh key to your git account. `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` copy paste to your profile.
5. clone the repo using the ssh link: `git clone git@github.com:W8CUL/ARC-HAB.git`
   
- Recommend using and setting up [obsidian-md](https://obsidian.md/) (this is a free note taking tool and you only need to install it most of the configuration is done to work with git and other requirements)

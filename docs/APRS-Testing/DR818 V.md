## Vcc testing

- Test setup: a bench power supply was used to power the radio and the internal current meater was used for reading
- at 3.3 V
	- RF low: 0.56 A
	- RF high: 0.8 A
	- Standby: 0.05 A
- at 4.2 V
	- low: 0.67 A
	- high: 1.2 A
- at 5.0 V
	- high: 1.3 A
- at 2.5 V or below the radio dose not TX
	- UART interface was working

## Science

- Discussed Potential Project ideas,
	These include looking into remote sensing data and comparing that to the observed in-situ data from balloon launches. In addition we would like to launch balloons into storm fronts, potentially with multiple balloon launches
  
- Current Action items,
	- Look into proccesors to control the instruments onboard the science payload
	- Start familiarizing ourselves with satelite data and python coding 

----
## Trackers

- Science wants to know what is the max data rate we can give
	- 3 kb/s - if meshtastic works
	- APRS - packet every 30 s
		- May be able to improve to 3 s intervals

### APRS
- Hasith: Gave an update of the system leading up to V4
- Improvements planned
- Potential learning outcomes
- Even was interested in PCB design 
### Meshtastic

- Riely: showed a demo on a meshtastic node and

### ATV

- Ian - Fill this in. (Not sure what was discussed)
